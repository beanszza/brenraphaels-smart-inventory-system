# Agent notes


## No polling

No app polls (ADR-0005 in the Portal repo, `docs/adr/0005-no-polling-anywhere.md`). Never repeat a data request on a timer, window focus or tab visibility; use the WebSocket, refetch on (re)connect, or refetch on a user action. A 30–60 second in-memory heartbeat is a keepalive, not polling, and timers that never touch the network (clocks, countdowns) are fine. Idle-tab check: `tests/no-polling.test.ts` and `tests/notifications-live.test.ts`.
